actions/getImages.js - make sure all images are loaded (Promise.all?)
  then fire the dispatch.

canvas/Canvas.js - move the <canvas> element to another file/component
  with forwarding refs: https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html

header/Header.js - Login and Logout is broken

.eslintrc.js - Turned off eslint for import/prefer-default-export to prevent
  action creators from making that error. Fixing that error will break the
  action creators, especially getCanvasContext and getMouseCoords

.eslintrc.js - Turned off eslint for no-undef (https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-undef)
  to prevent certain environmental variables from causing error. Need to add
  env to config to fix error but env causes Eslint to crash.
